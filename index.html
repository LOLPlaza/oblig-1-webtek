                    of the hit show 'Arcane', made to make her base model
                    resemble the animated character better</p>

            <div>This is jinx's lunar revel skin, which are based on the chinese
                new year. Her minigun basic attacks feel especially sharp when
                you use this skin, and her traps and mega rocket are all shaped
                as festival dragons.</div>

            <div>Here you can see her project skin, which is more of a
                bioengineering themed skin line. This skin's main appeal
                comes from the mask that she wears, which is unique to this
                skin. Other than that it feels like a purple and cleaner version
                of the odyssey skin (which will not be mentioned here for
                obvious reasons)</div>
